# Some properties of estimators

---

## Unbiasedness

An estimator $\hat{\theta}_n$ is unbiased for an estimand $\theta$ if

$$
\textrm{E}[\hat{\theta}_n] = \theta
$$
--

- In expectation, the value of our estimator is the same as our estimand. 

--

- Unbiasedness is a helpful quality, but it is not the only thing we care about. 

---
## Consistency

An estimator $\hat{\theta}_n$ is consistent for an estimand $\theta$ if

$$
\hat{\theta}_n \overset{p}{\to} \theta
$$
--

- As we get more data, estimates produced by our estimator are less likely to be far away from our estimand. 

--

- Why might we care about consistency?

---
### Some examples:

--

Our target is the population mean. We have an i.i.d. sample. 

--

- The sample mean is both unbiased and a consistent estimator for the population mean. 

--

- What if our estimator just uses the first observation as a guess for $\theta$, every time we take a sample, no matter the sample size? 
--
Is this unbiased? 
--
Is this consistent?

--

- What if our estimator is $\frac{1}{n-3}\sum_{i = 1}^n X_i$? 
--
Is this unbiased? Is this consistent?

--

Which estimator is better? 
--
How do we evaluate "better?"


---

## Mean squared error

- We sometimes use mean squared error as a metric to evaluate the relative quality of an estimator. 

$$
\textrm{E}[(\hat\theta_n - \theta)^2]
$$

--

$$
= \textrm{Var}[\hat \theta] + \textrm{bias}[\hat\theta]^2
$$
--

- When we compare estimators, we say the estimator with the lower MSE is more *efficient*. 



---

- We have some data that are produced from an i.i.d. sampling procedure. 

--
- We've selected an estimating procedure, and produced a point estimate of some target estimand using our estimating procedure. 

--
- We then produced an estimate of the standard error of our estimate. 

--
- Now we would like to be able to say something what that means. 


---
One way to do this is to use our estimated standard errors to give an interval of uncertainty around our point estimate. 

---

# Confidence intervals

- A valid confidence interval $CI_n$ for a target parameter $\theta$ with coverage $1-\alpha$
$$
\textrm{P}[\theta \in CI_n]\ge 1- \alpha
$$
--

- If $\alpha = 0.05$, the probability that the estimand $\theta$ is in our confidence interval is greater than or equal to 0.95.

--


- $CI_n$ is a random interval. It is a function of the data we observe. 

--

- $\theta$ is a fixed parameter. It does not move. 

--
(In the frequentist view of statistics.)

--

- If you use valid confidence repeatedly in your work, 95% of the time, your confidence intervals will include the true value of the relevant $\theta.$

---

- We could trivially define valid confidence intervals by including the entire support of the data. 
--
(Why wouldn't we want to do that?)

---

## Normal approximation-based confidence intervals

Let $\hat\theta_n$ be an asymptotically normal estimator of some estimand $\theta$. Let $\hat{\textrm{se}}$ be a consistent estimator of the standard error of the estimate. 

--

Since $\hat\theta_n$ is asymptotically normal, we can discuss coverage in terms of the normal distribution. 


---

Recall the normal distribution. It has a bell curve shape, with more density around the middle, and less density at more extreme values. 


```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height=5, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE}
result_n <- rnorm(n = 10000)
plotdata <- tibble(
  x = result_n,
  Fx = pnorm(result_n),
  fx = dnorm(result_n)
)

g <- ggplot(plotdata, aes(x = x, y = fx)) +
  geom_line() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-2.5, 2.5),
                  ylim = c(0,0.5)) +
  ggtitle('PDF of Standard Normal Distribution')

g +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 'dashed', color = 'skyblue') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, xend = -1, y = 0.2, yend = 0.2), 
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm")), color = 'skyblue') +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, xend = 1, y = 0.2, yend = 0.2), 
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm")), color = 'skyblue') +
  geom_point(aes(x = 0, y = 0.2), color = 'skyblue') + 
  annotate(geom="text", x = 0.5, y = .19, label = as.character(expression(sigma)), parse = TRUE, color = 'steelblue') + 
  annotate(geom="text", x = -0.5, y = .19, label = as.character(expression(sigma)), parse = TRUE, color = 'steelblue') + 
  annotate(geom="text", x = 0.075, y = .42, label = as.character(expression(theta)), parse = TRUE, color = 'steelblue')

```


---

For $0 \le c \le 1$,  $z(c)$ describes the $c$-th quantile of the normal distribution. 

--

In terms of the standard normal distribution, $\Phi(z(c)) = c$, where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the CDF of the distribution.

--

For example, the 5th quantile describes the point which is greater than 5% of the distribution. 


```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height=5, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE}
g +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                geom = "area",
                fill = "skyblue",
                xlim = c(-10, qnorm(0.05))) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = qnorm(0.05), lty = 'dashed', color = 'skyblue') +  
  annotate(geom="text", x = qnorm(0.05), y = .2, label = round(qnorm(0.05), 3), parse = TRUE, color = 'steelblue')

```


---

For $0 \le c \le 1$,  $z(c)$ describes the $c$-th quantile of the normal distribution. 


In terms of the standard normal distribution, $\Phi(z(c)) = c$, where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the CDF of the distribution.

The 95th quantile describes the point which is greater than 95% of the distribution. 


```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height=5, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE}
g +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                geom = "area",
                fill = "skyblue",
                xlim = c(-10, qnorm(0.95))) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = qnorm(0.95), lty = 'dashed', color = 'skyblue') +  
  annotate(geom="text", x = qnorm(0.95), y = .2, label = round(qnorm(0.95), 3), parse = TRUE, color = 'steelblue')


```


---

We can calculate $z(c)$ in R using the `qnorm()` function, which reports the value of quantile input. 

By default, it gives us the value wrt the standard normal distribution, with mean 0 and sd 1. 

```{r}
qnorm(0.05)
qnorm(0.95)
```

--

Notice that for the standard normal distribution, with mean 0, these quantiles are symmetric around zero. 

---

If we want to describe symmetric bounds around the mean that contain 95% of the distribution, this would be from the 2.5th percentile to the 97.5th percentile. 

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height=5, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE}
g +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                geom = "area",
                fill = "skyblue",
                xlim = c(qnorm(0.025), qnorm(0.975))) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = qnorm(0.975), lty = 'dashed', color = 'skyblue') + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = qnorm(0.025), lty = 'dashed', color = 'skyblue') +  
  annotate(geom="text", x = qnorm(0.025), y = .2, label = round(qnorm(0.025), 3), parse = TRUE, color = 'steelblue') +  
  annotate(geom="text", x = qnorm(0.975), y = .2, label = round(qnorm(0.975), 3), parse = TRUE, color = 'steelblue')


```

--

These values are about -2 and 2. We will use them a lot. 

---


Now, we can define the normal approximation-based confidence interval as:

$$
CI\_n = \left(\hat \theta\_n - z\_{1-\alpha/2} \times \hat{\textrm{se}},\  \theta\_n + z\_{1-\alpha/2}\times \hat{\textrm{se}} \right)
$$


--

For the 95% confidence interval, $\alpha = 0.05$ and, $z_{1-\alpha/2} \approx 1.96$.

$$
CI\_n = \left(\hat \theta\_n - 1.96 \times \hat{\textrm{se}},\  \theta\_n + 1.96 \times \hat{\textrm{se}} \right)
$$

--
Then,

$$
\textrm{P}[\theta \in CI_n] \rightarrow 1- \alpha.
$$

Asymptotically, the normal approximation-based confidence interval will have correct coverage. 

---

Returning to our example where we flip a coin twice, let $X$ be the number of heads we observe. Our coin is *not* fair, and the probability of getting a heads is 0.8. 

```{r}
X <- c(0, 1, 2)
fx <- c(1/16, 3/8, 9/16)
(Ex <- sum(X*fx))
```


--

Let's take a sample of size $n = 100$ from this distribution, and see what our confidence intervals look like. 

```{r}
n <- 100
x_observed <- sample(X, prob = fx, replace = TRUE, size = n)

head(x_observed)
```

---

Our estimates of the mean and standard error of the mean. 

```{r}
(theta_hat <- mean(x_observed))
(se_hat <- sd(x_observed)/sqrt(n))
```

--

Our quantile. 

```{r}
(z975 <- qnorm(0.975))
```


--

Putting it together, the 95% normal approxmation-based confidence interval. 

```{r}
(CI95 <- c(theta_hat + c(-1,1)*z975*se_hat))
```

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align="center"}
ggplot(tibble(conf_lower = CI95[1], conf_upper = CI95[2], mean = theta_hat), 
       aes(y = 1, x = mean)) + 
  geom_point(color = 'skyblue') +
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin=conf_lower,xmax=conf_upper), color = 'skyblue', alpha = 0.85) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1.25, 1.75),) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = Ex, color = 'black', lty = 'dashed') +
  theme(axis.title.y=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank()) +
  ggtitle('95% Normal Approximation-Based CI, 2 Weighted Coin Flips, Sample Size = 100')
  
```


---

What if we did this many times?

--

```{r}
n_iter <- 50
x_list <- map(1:n_iter, ~ sample(X, prob = fx, replace = TRUE, 
                                 size = n))
```

--

```{r}
CI_95f <- function(x){
  theta_hat <- mean(x)
  se_hat <- sd(x)/sqrt(n)
  CI_hat <- theta_hat + 
    c('conf_lower' = -1, 'conf_upper' = 1)*qnorm(0.975)*se_hat
}
  
sample_CIs <- map(x_list, CI_95f) 

head(sample_CIs, 3)
```

---

```{r}
CI_n <- bind_rows(sample_CIs)

head(CI_n)
```


---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align="center"}
ggplot(tibble(CI_n), 
       aes(y = seq(from = 0, to = 2, length.out = n_iter), x = 1)) + 
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin=conf_lower,xmax=conf_upper), color = 'skyblue', alpha = 0.85) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1.25, 1.75)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = Ex, color = 'black', lty = 'dashed') +
  theme(axis.title.y=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank()) +
  ggtitle('95% Normal Approximation-Based CI, 2 Weighted Coin Flips, Sample Size = 100')
```

---
The true mean stays the same. 
--
The confidence intervals change, based on the sample. 

--

```{r}
mean( (Ex >= CI_n$conf_lower) & (Ex <= CI_n$conf_upper) )
```

---

What if we did this many more times?

--

```{r}
x_list <- map(1:5000, ~ sample(X, prob = fx, replace = TRUE, 
                                 size = n))
CI_n <- map(x_list, CI_95f) %>% bind_rows()
```

--

```{r}
mean( (Ex >= CI_n$conf_lower) & (Ex <= CI_n$conf_upper) )
```

## Applied example



We can see this in action with respect to a paper by Devah Pager: 


Pager, D. (2003). The mark of a criminal record. *American Journal of Sociology*, 108(5), 937-975.

---


The study was an audit study, where pairs of white and pairs of black hypothetical job applicants applied to real jobs. 

--

In each pair, one respondent listed a criminal record on job applications; the other did not. Otherwise, applicants were matched. 

--

The outcome is whether applicants got a callback. 

---


```{r, message=FALSE}
mcr <- tibble(
  black = rep(c(0, 1), times = c(300, 400)),
  record = c(rep(c(0, 1), each = 150), 
             rep(c(0, 1), each = 200)),
  call_back = c(
    # whites without criminal records
    rep(c(0, 1), times = c(99, 51)), # 150
    # whites with criminal records
    rep(c(0, 1), times = c(125, 25)), # 150: could be 25 or 26
    # blacks without criminal records
    rep(c(0, 1), times = c(172, 28)), # 200
    # blacks with criminal records
    rep(c(0, 1), times = c(190, 10)) # 200 
  )
)

```



---
class:small-output

# 

```{r, message = FALSE}
mcr %>% 
  group_by(black, record) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), 
            call_back = mean(call_back))
```

```{r pdb_fig, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/pager_2003.png')
```




---

Let's say our $\hat{\theta}$ here is the overall mean of `call_back` among black applicants.

```{r}
(theta_hat <- mcr %>% 
   filter(black == 1) %>% 
   summarize(mean(call_back)) %>% 
   pull)
```
--

Our $\hat{se}$ is our estimate of the standard error of the mean, 
$$\hat{se} = \sqrt{\hat{\textrm{Var}}[X]/n}.$$ 

--

We get this by plugging in our unbiased sample variance estimate into the formula for the standard error of the mean. 

```{r}
(se_hat <- mcr %>% 
   filter(black == 1) %>% 
   summarize(sqrt(var(call_back)/length(call_back))) %>% 
   pull)

```

---

We can then get our 95% confidence intervals by plugging into the formula, 


$$
CI\_n = \left(\hat \theta\_n - 1.96 \times \hat{\textrm{se}},\  \theta\_n + 1.96 \times \hat{\textrm{se}} \right)
$$


```{r}
(CI <- c(theta_hat + c(-1,1)*qnorm(1-0.025)*se_hat))
```

---

We can see the exact same confidence intervals in the output of `lm` or `estimatr::lm_robust`, if we use the `confint()` function with the `.default` version, which gives the asymptotically normal confidence intervals.

```{r}

model <- estimatr::lm_robust(call_back ~1, data = mcr %>% filter(black == 1))

confint.default(model)
```

---
## Bootstrapping

The normal approximation based confidence intervals work with our standard error estimates produced from bootstrapping, as well. 

--

We'll apply this to our mcr data. 

```{r}

boot_ests <- map(1:1000, # for 1000 times
                 # resample w/replacement
                 ~ sample(mcr %>% filter(black == 1) 
                          %>% pull(call_back), 
                          replace = TRUE) %>%
                   mean()) # and calculate the resampled mean

boot_vec <- unlist(boot_ests)

(boot_se_hat <- sd(boot_vec))
```

---

We then insert our bootstrapped estimates of the standard error of the mean into the same formula for normal approximation-based confidence intervals. 

$$
CI\_n = \left(\hat \theta\_n - z\_{1-\alpha/2} \times \hat{\textrm{se}},\  \theta\_n + z\_{1-\alpha/2}\times \hat{\textrm{se}} \right)
$$


```{r}
(CI <- c(theta_hat + c(-1,1)*qnorm(1-0.025)*boot_se_hat))
```

---

By default, `lm_robust` gives confidence intervals that are adjusted for the sample size--for models with one parameter, these are equivalent in large samples to our normal approximation estimators. 

---

To see exactly the same confidence intervals as in `lm_robust`, we can use the Student t distribution with the degrees of freedom, which we extract from the object. 

Degrees of freedom tell us how many observations we had in our sample, minus how many parameters we used in our model. 

```{r}
model
(dof <- model$df)

(CI <- c(theta_hat + c(-1,1)*qt(1-0.025, dof)*se_hat))
```



---
# Hypothesis testing

In our randomization inference section, we specified the null distribution in terms of the individual treatment effect. 

--

When we use the normal approximation to conduct inference, we generally posit our null with respect to the *mean* of the parameter, $\theta$. 
--
I.e., 

$$
H_0: \theta = \theta_0
$$

$$
H_A: \theta \neq \theta_0
$$
--
We can also consider a one-sided alternative, 

$$
H_A: \theta \leq \theta_0
$$
--
Or

$$
H_A: \theta \ge \theta_0
$$
--

Which alternative we choose is determined by the questions we're asking of the data. 

---

## p-values

Suppose $\hat{\theta}$ is the general form for an estimate produced by our estimator, and $\hat{\theta}^*$ is the value we have actually observed. 

---

## p-values

- A lower one-tailed $p$-value under the null hypothesis is 

$$
p = \textrm{P}\_0[\hat{\theta} \le \hat{\theta}^*]
$$

i.e., the probability *under the null distribution* that we would see an estimate of $\hat{\theta}$ that is less than or equal to what we saw from the data. 



---

## p-values



- An upper one-tailed $p$-value under the null hypothesis is:

$$
p = \textrm{P}\_0[\hat{\theta} \ge \hat{\theta}^*]
$$

i.e., the probability *under the null distribution* that we would see an estimate of $\hat{\theta}$ that is greater than or equal to what we saw from the data. 

---

## p-values

- A two-tailed $p$-value under the null hypothesis is 

$$
p = \textrm{P}\_0[|\hat{\theta}| \ge |\hat{\theta}^*|]
$$

i.e., the probability *under the null distribution* that we would see an estimate of $\hat{\theta}$ as or more extreme as what we saw from the data. 




---

## T-statistic

How do we produce our $p$-values under the normal approximation based approach?

--

Suppose $\hat{\theta}$ is the general form for an estimate produced by our asymptotically normal estimator, and let $\hat{\theta}^*$ be the value of the estimate we have actually observed. 

Let $\hat{se}$ be a consistent estimator of the sampling variance of the estimator. 

--

The *t-statistic* is:
$$
t = \frac{\hat{\theta}^* - \theta_0}{\hat{se}}
$$

---

The t-statistic will tell us how unusual our evidence is relative to the null distribution, but it is standardized, so that we can interpret t-statistics the same way in different settings. 

---

## Normal-approximation based p-values

We'll use the t-statistic to get our $p$-values. 

--

We plug the t-statistic produced by our estimates into the CDF function of the standard normal distribution, $\Phi(\cdot)$. 

--

- For an asymptotically valid lower one-tailed $p$-value **under the null**, 

$$
p = \Phi\left( \frac{\hat{\theta}^* - \theta_0}{\hat{se}} \right)
$$

--

- For an asymptotically valid upper one-tailed $p$-value **under the null**, 

$$
p = 1 - \Phi\left( \frac{\hat{\theta}^* - \theta_0}{\hat{se}} \right)
$$


--

- For an asymptotically valid two-tailed $p$-value **under the null**

$$
p = 2 \times \left(1 -  \Phi\left(  \frac{\lvert \hat{\theta}^* - \theta_0 \rvert}{\hat{se}}  \right)\right)
$$

---
## Applied example

Let's try it out with the mcr data. 

--

Recall that our $\hat{\theta}^*$ is the mean of `call_back`.


```{r}
theta_hat
```

--

And our $\hat{se}$ is our estimate of the standard error of the mean, 
$$\hat{se} = \sqrt{\hat{\textrm{Var}}[X]/n};$$ 

```{r}
se_hat
```


---

Suppose we frame our null in terms of the average call back rate among black respondents being 10%. 
--
This could be the known average callback rate across the overall population. 

--


$$
H_0: \theta = 0.10 
$$

---
This is the null distribution we're using for the sample mean under the normal approximation-based approach. 

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height=5, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE}
result_n <- rnorm(n = 10000, mean = 0.10, sd = se_hat)
plotdata <- tibble(
  x = result_n,
  Fx = pnorm(result_n, mean = 0.10, sd = se_hat),
  fx = dnorm(result_n, mean = 0.10, sd = se_hat)
)

g <- ggplot(plotdata, aes(x = x, y = fx)) +
  geom_line() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(qnorm(0.000001, mean = 0.10, sd = se_hat), 
                           qnorm(0.999999, mean = 0.10, sd = se_hat))) +
  ggtitle('Null Distribution of the Sample Mean')

g +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.10, lty = 'dashed', color = 'skyblue') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.10, xend = 0.10-se_hat, y = 15, yend = 15), 
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm")), color = 'skyblue') +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.10, xend = 0.10 + se_hat, y = 15, yend = 15), 
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm")), color = 'skyblue') +
  geom_point(aes(x = 0.10, y = 15), color = 'skyblue') + 
  annotate(geom="text", x = 0.10 - se_hat/2, y = 14, label = as.character(expression(sigma)), parse = TRUE, color = 'steelblue') + 
  annotate(geom="text", x = 0.10 + se_hat/2, y = 14, label = as.character(expression(sigma)), parse = TRUE, color = 'steelblue') + 
  annotate(geom="text", x = 0.10 + .001, y = 20, label = as.character(expression(theta)), parse = TRUE, color = 'steelblue')

```

--

- The mean is our proposed $\theta_0 = 0.10$, 

--
- the standard error is the same as what we estimated, `r round(se_hat, 3)`. 

---


Our t-statistic under the null is:

$$
\frac{\hat{\theta}^* - \theta_0}{\hat{se}}
$$

Recall that the $p$-value is calculated *under the assumption that the null is true*, so $\theta_0$ is the value of $\theta$ under the null. 

```{r}
(tstat <- (theta_hat - 0.10)/se_hat)
```

---




We will consider a couple of different alternative hypotheses. 

---

First, we'll consider the one-tailed alternative hypothesis that $\theta$ is less than $\theta_0 = 0.10$.


$$
H_A: \theta \leq 0.10
$$

--
To evaluate this, we calculate our one-sided lower p-value as:

$$
p = \Phi\left(  \frac{\hat{\theta}^* - \theta_0}{\hat{se}}  \right)
$$

--

```{r}
(lower_p_value <- pnorm(tstat))
```

--

How do we interpret this?

--

It is the probability *under the null distribution* that we would see an estimate of $\hat{\theta}$ that is less than or equal to what we saw from the data.


---



```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height=5, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE}
g +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(mean = 0.10, sd = se_hat),
                geom = "area",
                fill = "skyblue",
                xlim = c(0, qnorm(lower_p_value, mean = 0.10, sd = se_hat))) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = theta_hat, color = 'skyblue', lty= 'dashed') +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.09, xend = 0.04 + se_hat, y = 15, yend = 15), 
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm")), color = 'darkgray') +
  annotate('text', x = .06, y = 12.5, color = 'darkgray', 
           label = 'area under the curve in this direction', size = 6)

```



---


Then, we'll consider the two-sided alternative hypothesis that $\theta$ is not equal to $\theta_0 = 0.10$. 


$$
H_A: \theta \neq 0.10
$$

--
Then we calculate our two-tailed  p-value as

$$
p = 2 \times \left(1 -  \Phi\left(  \frac{\lvert \hat{\theta}^* - \theta_0 \rvert}{\hat{se}}  \right)\right)
$$

--

```{r}
(two_tailed_p_value <- 2*(1 - pnorm(abs(tstat))))
```

--

How do we interpret this?

--

It is the probability *under the null distribution* that we would see an estimate of $\hat{\theta}$ that is more extreme than what we saw from the data. 
--

This is a high probability; we would fail to reject the null at any kind of conventional $p$-value (0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, ...). 


---



```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height=5, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE}
g +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(mean = 0.10, sd = se_hat),
                geom = "area",
                fill = "skyblue",
                xlim = c(0, qnorm(lower_p_value, mean = 0.10, sd = se_hat))) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(mean = 0.10, sd = se_hat),
                geom = "area",
                fill = "skyblue",
                xlim = c(qnorm(1-lower_p_value, mean = 0.10, sd = se_hat), 1)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = theta_hat, color = 'skyblue', lty= 'dashed') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.10+0.10-theta_hat, color = 'skyblue', lty= 'dashed') +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.09, xend = 0.04 + se_hat, y = 15, yend = 15), 
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm")), color = 'darkgray') +
  annotate('text', x = .06, y = 12.5, color = 'darkgray', 
           label = 'area under the curve in this direction', size = 6) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.10+0.10-0.09, xend = 0.10+0.10-(0.04 + se_hat), y = 15, yend = 15), 
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm")), color = 'darkgray') +
  annotate('text', x = 0.10+0.10-.06, y = 8.5, color = 'darkgray', 
           label = 'and this direction', size = 6)

## Duality of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing



Let's consider the null hypothesis that the mean is 0, applied to the mcr data. 

$$
H_0: \theta = 0 
$$
$$
H_A: \theta \neq 0 
$$


---

Our t-statistic under the null is:

$$
\frac{\hat{\theta}^* - \theta_0}{\hat{se}}
$$

```{r}
(tstat <- (theta_hat - 0)/se_hat)
```

--

Then we calculate our two-tailed  p-value as

$$
p = 2 \times \left(1 -  \Phi\left(  \frac{\lvert \hat{\theta}^* - \theta_0 \rvert}{\hat{se}}  \right)\right)
$$

```{r}
(two_tailed_p_value <- 2*(1 - pnorm(abs(tstat))))
```



---
This is the null distribution we're using for the sample mean under the normal approximation-based approach.

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height=5, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
result_n <- rnorm(n = 10000, mean = 0, sd = se_hat)
plotdata <- tibble(
  x = result_n,
  Fx = pnorm(result_n, mean = 0, sd = se_hat),
  fx = dnorm(result_n, mean = 0, sd = se_hat)
)

g <- ggplot(plotdata, aes(x = x, y = fx)) +
  geom_line() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(qnorm(0.000001, mean = 0, sd = se_hat), 
                           qnorm(0.999999, mean = 0, sd = se_hat))) +
  ggtitle('Null Distribution of the Sample Mean')
```

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height=5, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
g +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-.1, .1))
```


---

           label = 'and this direction', size = 6)

```

--

Our $p$-value is very small; we would reject the null hypothesis at a $p$-value $< 0.001$. 

---

- Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests have a specific relationship. 

---

- Consider all of the hypotheses that take the form:

$$
H_0: \theta = \theta_0
$$
$$
H_A: \theta \neq \theta_0
$$

--

- If the calculated two-tailed $p$-value is less than $0.05$, reject the hypothesis. 

--

- If the calculated two-tailed $p$-value is greater than $0.05$, fail to reject the hypothesis. 

--

- The $\theta_0$ for which we would fail to reject the hypothesis lie within the 95% confidence interval. 



---
One way that this is very useful:

- If $0$ is outside the 95% confidence interval, we would reject the hypothesis that $\theta = 0$ at $p = 0.05$. 

--

- If $0$ is outside the 99% confidence interval, we would reject the hypothesis that $\theta = 0$ at $p = 0.01$. 

---

# Inference for linear models

We have already seen that when we regress $Y$ on an indicator, we just get the sample mean of $Y$. 

--

In this case, estimating standard errors and confidence intervals follows the same procedures as for sample means. 


```{r}
model <- estimatr::lm_robust(call_back ~1, 
                             data = mcr %>% filter(black == 1))

model$coefficients
model$std.error

confint.default(model)
```


---

We can think about parameters in a linear model in a similar way. 

$$
\textrm{E}[Y| X] = \beta_0 + {\beta}_1 X
$$ 

--

The true population parameters are generally unknown. 

---

We estimate them for a given sample. 

$$ \hat{Y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 +  \hat{\beta}_1 X_i $$ 

--

We will think about our random sample being not just for one variable, but from the joint distribution of $(Y, X)$. 

--

Then each $\hat{\beta}_k$ is also random, with its own sampling distribution. 

--

We can get a point estimate for each of the parameters, $\hat{\beta}_k$: the coefficients in our linear model. 

--

We also want to get an estimate of the standard errors of the estimates, $\sqrt{\hat{\textrm{Var}}[\hat{\beta}_k]}$. 

---
## Robust standard errors

We will use *robust* standard errors; these standard errors don't require much beyond that our data is i.i.d.


--

- "classical" regression modeling puts much stronger assumptions on the data, including that errors are "homoskedastic;" they don't vary with $X$


---

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height=6, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE}
X <- runif(1000)
Y <- 3*X + rnorm(1000, sd = 0.6)
Y2 <- 3*X + rnorm(1000)*X


df <- tibble(X, Y, Y2)

g1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = X, y = Y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-0.25, 5.25)) + 
  ggtitle('Homoskedastic data')

g2 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = X, y = Y2)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-0.25, 5.25)) +
  ggtitle('Heteroskedastic data')


grid.arrange(g1, g2, ncol=2)
```


---

## Bootstrapping

- We can estimate robust standard errors by bootstrapping. 

--

Let's try this with the mcr data, where the outcome $Y$ is `call_back`, regressed on `black` and `record`, interacted. 

$$
\hat{Y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \textrm{Black}_i + \hat{\beta}_2 \textrm{Record}_i + \hat{\beta}_3 \textrm{Black}_i  \times \textrm{Record}_i
$$


```{r}

model2 <- estimatr::lm_robust(call_back ~ black*record, data = mcr)

(theta_hats <- coef(model2))
```

---


```{r}
boot_samples <- map(1:1000, # for 1000 times
                    # resample w/replacement
                    ~ slice_sample(mcr, replace = TRUE, n = nrow(mcr)))

head(boot_samples, 2)
```


---

```{r}
boot_lm <- map(boot_samples, 
               ~ estimatr::lm_robust(call_back ~ black*record, data = .) %>% 
                 coef())

head(boot_lm)
```

---

```{r}
boot_lm_df <- bind_rows(boot_lm)

boot_lm_df
```

---

```{r}
boot_se_hats <- boot_lm_df %>% 
  map_dbl(sd) 

boot_se_hats
```

---

We then insert our bootstrapped estimates of the standard error of the mean into the same formula for normal approximation-based confidence intervals--**for each estimated coefficient and standard error separately**. 

$$
CI\_n = \left(\hat \theta\_n - z\_{1-\alpha/2} \times \hat{\textrm{se}},\  \theta\_n + z\_{1-\alpha/2}\times \hat{\textrm{se}} \right)
$$

---

```{r}
boot_ci <- bind_cols(term = names(theta_hats), 
          est = theta_hats, 
          boot_se = as.numeric(boot_se_hats)) %>% 
  mutate(conf_lower = est - qnorm(.975)*boot_se,
         conf_upper = est + qnorm(.975)*boot_se)

boot_ci
```

---

Consider the standard errors produced by `estimatr::lm_robust()` :
```{r}
estimatr::lm_robust(call_back ~ black*record, data = mcr) %>% 
                                                   broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, std.error)
```
--

Compare these to the standard errors produced by `lm()`

```{r}
summary(lm(call_back ~ black*record, data = mcr)) %>% 
                                                   broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, std.error)
```



---

- `estimatr::lm_robust()` outputs robust standard errors by default; this is why it's really nice to use. 

--

- (There are options for different types of robust standard errors which have different small sample properties, but they're asymptotically equivalent.)

# Appendix (for reference): Difference in means


---
## Difference in means

The case where we have a simple difference in means is a special case. 
--
Let's compare respondents with and without records. 


```{r}
model3 <- estimatr::lm_robust(call_back ~ record, data = mcr)

model3$coefficients
```


--

We have seen that the coefficient estimate produced by the model coincides with the difference-in-means estimate. 

```{r}
Y1 <- filter(mcr, record == 1) %>% pull(call_back)
Y0 <- filter(mcr, record == 0) %>% pull(call_back)

(dm_hat <- mean(Y1) - mean(Y0))

```

---

## Normal approximation based approach

For the difference in two means from i.i.d. data, $Y$ and $Z$, each sample mean is approximately normally distributed, and a linear combination of normal random variables is also approximately normally distributed:

$$
\bar Y - \bar Z \mathrel{\dot\sim} \mathcal{N}\left( \textrm{E}[Y] - \textrm{E}[Z], \sigma^2\left(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{m} \right) \right)
$$
where $n$ is the sample assigned to $Y$, and $m$ is the sample assigned to $Z$. 

---

Generally, we will not know $\sigma^2$, so we can estimate it as a weighted average of the unbiased sample variances of $Y$ and $Z$ respectively using the **pooled sample variance**. 

$$
S^2_p =\frac{(n-1) S^2_Y + (m-1)S^2_Z }{m + n -2} 
$$

--

For our difference in callbacks with and without records. 

```{r}
n <- length(Y1)
m <- length(Y0)
var_hat1 <- var(Y1)
var_hat0 <- var(Y0)
s2p <- ( (n-1)*var_hat1 + (m-1)*var_hat0 )/(m + n -2)
```


---

```{r}
(dm_se_hat <- sqrt(s2p)*sqrt(1/n + 1/m)) # estimate of standard error of diff in means
(dm_tstat <- dm_hat/(sqrt(s2p)*sqrt(1/n + 1/m))) # t-statistic for diff in means
```

--
And then calculating confidence intervals

```{r}

dm_hat + c(-1, 1)*qnorm(1-0.025)*dm_se_hat # confidence interval
```


--
Compare these to the standard error and t-statistic under `estimatr::lm_robust()`

```{r}
model3
```


---
Again, you can reproduce the confidence interval produced by `lm_robust` using `qt()` and the degrees of freedom, instead of `qnorm()` for the quantiles. 


```{r}
(dof <- model2$df[2]) # degrees of freedom

# compare to:
m + n -2

dm_hat + c(-1, 1)*qt(1-0.025, dof)*dm_se_hat
```
